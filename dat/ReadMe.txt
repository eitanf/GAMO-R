All averaged over 1000 experiments

Each folder contains .dat files and .png of graph produced
a values and # local max are in folder title

Folder names: worst2(a value)_binary(a value)_#localmax
                - binary.dat
                - worst2.dat
                - image of graph produced 

reps used (all on 5 bits):
    binary = standard binary
    worst2 = [24, 1, 4, 19, 15, 16, 21, 13, 9, 26, 18, 0, 23, 12, 6, 22, 3, 28, 20, 14, 30, 7, 5, 27, 29, 10, 8, 31, 2, 17, 25, 11]
